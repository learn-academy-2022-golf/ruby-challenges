# Create a method called sum_these_numbers which takes two integers as an argument and prints their sum to the screen.

# def sum_these_numbers(num1, num2)

# Create a method called is_even, which takes a single integer, and which then returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise.

# def is_even(num)    
#     if num % 2 == 0
#         true
#     else

# Output: false

# Create a method that takes a number as an argument and prints "Valid" if the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and "Invalid" otherwise.

# def valid(num)
#     if num >= 1 && num <= 10
#         "Valid"
#     else
#         "Invalid"
